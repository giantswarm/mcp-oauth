## [Unreleased]

### Security

- **Fixed timing attack vulnerability in state parameter validation (#19)**
  - Added minimum length validation (32 characters) for state parameters
  - State validation now enforces sufficient entropy for CSRF protection
  - Constant-time comparison already in place for state value validation
  - Added comprehensive tests for timing attack resistance
  - Updated all tests to use secure state parameters
  - Refactored validation logic to follow DRY principle and architectural patterns
  - State validation now centralized in server layer with handler doing input validation
  - Added compile-time test to ensure constant synchronization between packages
  - **Impact**: Short state parameters (< 32 chars) are now rejected
  - **Migration**: Ensure client applications generate state parameters with at least 32 characters
- **[BREAKING]** Added runtime HTTPS enforcement for OAuth server (#18, #49)
  - New `AllowInsecureHTTP` config flag (default: `false`)
  - Production deployments now require HTTPS by default
  - HTTP allowed only on localhost (127.0.0.0/8, ::1, 0.0.0.0) for development
  - Non-localhost HTTP deployments blocked unless explicitly allowed
  - Clear error messages guide developers to secure configuration
  - OAuth 2.1 compliance: HTTPS required for all production endpoints
  - **Migration**: 
    - For localhost development: Add `AllowInsecureHTTP: true` to suppress warnings
    - For production HTTP (not recommended): Add `AllowInsecureHTTP: true` and review security risks
    - **Recommended**: Switch to HTTPS for all environments

## [1.0.0] - 2025-11-23

### Added
- OAuth 2.1 Authorization Server implementation (proxying to Google)
- OAuth 2.1 Resource Server implementation (token validation)
- Protected Resource Metadata (RFC 9728)
- Authorization Server Metadata (RFC 8414)
- Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591)
- Token Revocation (RFC 7009)
- PKCE support with S256 method enforcement
- Token encryption at rest with AES-256-GCM
- Refresh token rotation with reuse detection
- Comprehensive audit logging with sensitive data hashing
- Rate limiting (per-IP and per-user)

- Google OAuth integration for Gmail, Drive, Calendar, etc.
- Cryptographically secure token generation

- Validates redirect URIs with scheme restrictions
- Implements bcrypt for client secret hashing
- Adds clock skew grace period (5 seconds)
- Rate limiting to prevent DoS and brute force attacks
- Token expiration with automatic cleanup
